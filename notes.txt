Sometimes we have to store images in our project so for that we have to setup some third Parrty services like cloiudimary or AWS
but befoore uploading images on that we have to keep then in a public folder do that even if ther is a problem they will be there on our server
we make a temp folder in public but git doesnt recognize it so to make it recognize we have to add a file named .gitkeep

Now we have setup the file structure for a proffesional grade project

Database Connection

whenever u put this in .env 
MongoDB_URL=mongodb+srv://priyanshu153:priyanshu123@cluster0.94y0f.mongodb.net
remove the last bracket



Pro tip :
Whenever u are usinf a database there are many errors so u always wrap things in a try catch block 
Database is always in another continent so it takes time so better u use always async await
