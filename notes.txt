Sometimes we have to store images in our project so for that we have to setup some third Parrty services like cloiudimary or AWS
but befoore uploading images on that we have to keep then in a public folder do that even if ther is a problem they will be there on our server
we make a temp folder in public but git doesnt recognize it so to make it recognize we have to add a file named .gitkeep

Now we have setup the file structure for a proffesional grade project

Database Connection

whenever u put this in .env 
MongoDB_URL=anything here 
remove the last bracket



Pro tip :
Whenever u are usinf a database there are many errors so u always wrap things in a try catch block 
Database is always in another continent so it takes time so better u use always async await



u need some more packages like cookie parser and cors 
because in express we have some function req.cookies


app.use   we generally use when we have some middlewares and parsers



Why we use cors package 

The cors package in Node.js is used to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). CORS is a security feature implemented by browsers that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page.

Why it's needed:
By default, browsers block cross-origin requests for security. If your frontend (e.g., running on localhost:3000) tries to access a backend API on localhost:5000, the browser will block the request unless CORS is enabled on the backend.

What the cors package does:
It allows you to specify which origins (domains) are allowed to access your server's resources, and under what conditions.

And we haeve one more package called cookie parser
